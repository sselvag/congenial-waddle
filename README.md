# Code Quiz
  
## As a coding boot camp student, I want to create a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores so that I can gauge my progress compared to my peers. In specific, this Code Quiz needs to include the following criteria: 
  1. When the start button in clicked, a timer must start and the user will be presented with the first question
  2. When a question is answered, the user will automatically be presented with the next question
  3. When an incorrect answer is chosen, time will be subtracted from the timer as penalty
  4. When all the questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, the game is over
  5. When the game is over, the user can save their initials and score



The following screenshots display different stages of the Code Quiz.
